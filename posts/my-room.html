                <p>My vintage clock was found in this store I would frequently walk by that was part bakery and part antique shop. It sadly closed down this past winter. There was an older man who manned the shop that had a Mid-Atlantic accent happy to show you his current oddities if you asked. I never bought any baked good and would always tell myself "next time". I would pilfer through all the knick-knacks on the shelves and rummage through the closet like space in the back for vintage items. This antique clock reminds me of the grandfather clock that once sat in my grandparents' home. My aunt has it now, but it is the most memorable object from visiting my grandparents' home when I was a child. It had the moon and the sun on the rotating plaque and every hour it rings. This felt like a very miniature version of the grandfather clock. The owner said it could work, but I still haven't gotten it to yet. </p>
