        <p>2024 feels like a comforting number. Maybe it is the way both the 2's are multiples of 4. And 4 is a stable number. Like a house. I heard this from a friend a few years ago and I convinced myself of this ever since. The new year has felt like a cozy blanket made of soft cashmere draped over me. Which in turn has put me into a perpetual sleepy state all of the sudden. They say that when you are with someone and you start to feel sleepy around them, it means they feel safe to you. Maybe this is the same thing but with the new year. That, or maybe I am deficient in some nutrient or something. I convinced myself that I finally exercised a slew of horrible entities out of my surroundings that were lurking around me last year and I can finally sleep. I start to think about what this means for my creativity now since I tend to feel more capable of writing mostly when I am under some sort of distress that has caused me to enter a state of hypomania. I have feared that having less disturbances in my head will cause me to be less creative. So much so that I have been intentionally taking melatonin to help induce weird dreams because that is what spurred my last entry.</p>
        <p>I sat up from my bed in the morning and looked at my closet that has those doors that are also two big mirrors. I used to be afraid of living in a room with those sorts of mirrors because of a deep rooted fear of Bloody Mary from childhood. Embarrassingly, even in my adulthood, this resulted in me never placing my bed in view of a mirror enough to where I can watch myself sleep in case she would appear in the mirror while I am sleeping and kill me. But alas, I got over it just this year because I loved this studio and its high ceilings and bay windows too much.</p>
        <p>I usually wake up and immediately put on my sweatshirt that I usually take off at around 2 in the morning in my sleep because I have a habit of shoving myself under 5 blankets including a heated weighted blanket to go to bed, hence waking up in the middle of night feeling deranged and overheated, but then cold and frigid upon waking up. After I put the hoodie back on, I look at myself in the mirror accepting that Bloody Mary hasn't murdered me in my sleep yet and put on the same lounge outfit that I designate as my house outfit. If you have a cat, you would understand this ritual of wearing and washing the same outfit to where in your house or else all of your clothes become riddled with fur. I ended up noticing that it has been a full month into 2024 and I have not cried. I put my fingertips to my tear ducts as if I am checking if they are working or clogged. I just thought about when the last time I went so long without finding something to cry about was. I wonder to myself if this is weird or not and then convince myself that you shouldn't go too long without crying. It can't be healthy, right? Everyone finds something to cry about at least once a month and I try to cry. I scan my brain as if I am looking for something I have been suppressing or ignoring. I let out a sigh.  Nothing happens and I feel incredibly silly and I get up to turn on my tea kettle for my first cup of tea. </p>
        <p>I snap myself out of it after my first sip of tea and just accept that I simply feel content...and dare I say â€“ <em>happy?</em>  I wrote that imagining myself covering my mouth as if I was holding in a secret or something I wasn't supposed to say.</p>
        <p>It's February, which of course means that its time to be mushy and lovey. Which has resulted in me committing to celebrating Valentines Day by presenting my valentine with a heart shaped cake. I have been so excited to bake this cake, while at the same time terrified of ruining it resulting in me spending my spare time watching cake piping tutorials online since I can't start baking the cake until it is the weekend after Valentines day which when it is also their birthday. I have the design all in my head. One of those vintage cakes with all the fancy piping. I bought the heart shaped pan, the piping tools, the swivel plate and everything. I even got a cardboard box to put it in.</p>
        <p>By now I think I have the process down. After the cake is baked, you cut off the tops to make it flat. Then you spread the icing on the top and add the second layer on top. Spread the icing all over and flatten it out until it is nice and smooth. Then you have to put it in the fridge so that when you decorate the icing doesn't smear all around. Take it out and carefully decorate.</p>

        <p>I in fact did not have the process down. This cake turned out slightly lopsided with goopy piping. My mom told me it looked like <em>"a cake you would see in spongebob"</em> laughing over the phone with me as I sat hunched over feeling silly. It took me a good five hours to make this earnest little 3 tiered cake.</p>

        <p>Luckily the humble little cake being a little goopy apparently made that cake even better. We ate it with little grins on our face, enjoying the spongebob-esque cake.</p>
