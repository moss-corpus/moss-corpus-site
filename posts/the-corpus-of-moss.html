            <p><span class="indent"></span>Today I embark into the ether into a deep black box of a writing practice.
                Deep
                black box adorned of Pandora's will. In other words, I am starting my formal writing practice. It lives
                here, in the moss corpus.I don't feel like capitalizing this title as to not draw too much attention
                towards myself as to keep this
                corpus an entity alone. Mind you, the author who keeps the moss corpus could attribute their own traits.

            <p>Introducing this site feels like announcing I am leaving a room before I open the door and saunter out
                pompously in front of a group of people, so please imagine you are reading this in a small crevice you
                find
                in a forest soaking the light that is peaking through lichen plastered tree trunks. No one is here. No
                one
                perceives the text that is swanning across the page except for you.</p>
            <p>I own a large middle aged cat, Julius, and he is sitting astutely appearing to be waiting for these words
                to
                fill my text editor. He judgingly looks at me with his half lit eyes, as if it is natural to just know
                what
                to say in a situation like this. "It is a corpus of moss, Julius." I mutter. "How is this not clear?"

            <p>Image Reference: The lily with its pure white and gold is, more than any flower, except the rose, fraught with sacred meaning. <br> The Angel Gabriel is recognized by the Lily and scepter he carries. He was the Angel of the Annunciateion, which feast is symbolized by the Lilium Candidum. Then, too, it is the flower of the Virgin Mary, and typifies purity and virginity. Through her it stands for the Human Nature of our Lord. <br>

            Blooming and Eastertide, the lily is an esquisite symbol of the Resurrection and in its very fragrance speaks of life eternal.<br>
