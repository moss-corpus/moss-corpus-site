        <p>I am falling upright, suddenly i am falling upright. I was falling and twisting. Slow, twist increasing in speed. Mouth open wide but no sound. It's in space. The complete feeling of space and nothingness. Nothingness.</p>
        <p>Gathering speed, my head was spinning more and more. Accelerating all the time and increasing in speed, just tumbling and falling.</p>
        <p>I try sometimes to think in myself, "well this is lovely you should be enjoying this but I'm so panic stricken." I see no cloud at all. I was falling through this water. That was all around me through this water.</p>
        <p>Seem to go down, down down. It's a long way down. It is very dark and deep. It is very dark and very deep.</p>
