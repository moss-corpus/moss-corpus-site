        <p>It is an earthly aura of feeling atuned to one another. That stare. It is doe eyed and lightly glassed with sunken kindness. Laughing and relating... gathering. Hoping that you would be so courteous to go for a walk together.</p>
        <p>"What is your favorite color?"</p>
        <p>The voice is human. Human-like enough. Only a bat can pick out the hyper frequencies that humans cannot detect from that voice. It howls and tears through the atmosphere, but left unknown amongst those who have ears.</p>
        <p>"Ultraviolet?" I say uncertain on if it is really the truth.</p>
        <p>I can't help but clutch the silver heart locket that I picked up from an antique stand outside of the grocery store and think how much I love the color of the gem embedded into it. A deep passionate ruby. I cared for that locket. I crafted that necklace after a long trip to most beautiful fabric store I could have ever stepped into to find a velvet ribbon to string it onto. I wear it loosely only over a mock neckline for the upmost Victorian modesty. It is my safety stone. A protection. A prayer.</p>
        <p>"Come on, let me show you my favorite path through the city." It hums.</p>
        <p>I follow and walk alongside them. Rambling about my favorite color and its origin. My attachment for the color violet. How I use an ultraviolet light to expose cyanotypes in my room. It's allegorical symbolism to naiveness. Light showing strength and resilience. The name I want to call my eventual daughter if God wills it. The flavor of my favorite candies. The powdery scent of incense that burns alongside frankincense in my room to make my room safe from intruding entities.</p>
        <p>"It is a color of solitude I think." I wonder. I like solitude. To be left in peace. Silence.<br>"I hear silence in that color."<br>
        The voice transforms slightly enough to become minimally atonal. It laughs with grace.<br>
        "You think that a color can evoke a sound?" The form questioned with entrusted curiosity.<br> "Surely, it can. I would imagine people could sense that from the color black quite often. Or white." I say.<br>
        "Both imply an absence. Depending on if it is additive or subtractive light."</p>
        <p>The form is silent for a bit. Pretending to preform the color ultraviolet in jest. The light behind their eyes starts to shift. Redshift light comes through their otherwise organically colored eyed stare signaling irregularity setting in, but subtly enough not to notice much.<br>
        "What beautiful eyes you have." I stare.<br>
        Their face embodies warmth and care. A porcelain like texture with subtle cool undertones. Their eyes sag with exhaustion and water at the corners. I am overfilled with agape love. They look back at me as their pupils start to become smaller and smaller until completely disappearing. Revealing only forrest encrusted irises. I clutch my bag that holds wine and cake a little tighter.<br>
        "What is that lipstick color?" I ask. I adore it.<br>
        "Black Honey" It croaks.<br>
        "May I try it on?"<br>
        Its hand rotates down like a lever slowly to offer me to try it on. I do. <br>
        "Feel better?" Their voice starts to separate in frequency</p>
