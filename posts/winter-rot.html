        <p>January feels like cold roses crushed up in my hand falling onto a vanilla cake with white icing. I might just be saying that partly because I have been seeing these white cakes with fake blood made of red corn syrup so that when you stab it, it looks like its squirting blood and I have been wanting to bake one ever since. Not because I want to stab something or anything. It just seems fun except you would have to eat red 40 and possibly go crazy. </p> 
        <p>2024 feels like a comforting number. I hope to find more inspiration to write and not only when I am under stress induced hypomania. The new year has felt like a cozy blanket made of soft cashmere draped over me. Which in turn has out me into a very sleepy state all of the sudden. They say that when you are with someone and you start to feel sleepy around them, it means they feel safe to you. Maybe this is the same thing but with the new year. It feels like I exercised a lot of horrible entities away that were lurking around me and I can finally sleep.</p>
